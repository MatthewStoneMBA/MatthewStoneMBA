# Hi, I'm Matthew 👋🏼

I am a Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Analyst. I recently graduated with a Masters in Data Science (Aug '21) on-top of my MBA ('20), both from Willamette University, go Bearcats! My drive is to integrate my business knowledge and data science methodologies to help make organizations better through objective decision making. Through my coursework and real world experiences, I have an array of projects ranging from developing Shiny App Dashboards to Natural Language Processing. Please check out my pinned Repo's for more information! 


* 🏈 At Willamette I was a student-athlete, participating in Collegiate football as a running-back, but I developed more-so as a leader. Being a Team Captain, a 2-year Member of the Leadership Committee and the recipient of the Bearcat Leadership Award following my final season.
